# Pong
This is a small and simple project that I created for my CISCO class. This project consists of nuxt.js and is just a simple single player pong game.

It's available at https://pong.uhteddy.xyz/

# How to play.
- Go to https://pong.uhteddy.xyz/
- Press play
- Use your cursor in the box and move it up and down to move your paddle. Your paddle will be yellow.
- Try to get the highest score to the computer.


# Fun information.
- Everytime you or the computer hits the ball the speed increases.
- Everytime you score on the computer, the computer gets more accurate at hitting it back.

# Local installation.
- You must have node.js installed. Node.js installs itself and npm (node package manager). Go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and install the latest version onto your machine.
- -To install the site on your local computer download the repository from github. https://github.com/uhteddy/pong 
- Unzip it to any area (preferably the desktop).
- CD into the directory
- cd Desktop
- cd pong-master
- run npm install in the terminal to install the proper npm packages
- After that, run npm run dev this will start a server on port 3000 (if it’s not already taken) via localhost.
- Go to http://localhost:3000 or http://127.0.0.1:3000/ 
- You’re all set
